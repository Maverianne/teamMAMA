  - 'Well, congrats to us, for trekking it this far! '
  - 'We''ve finally arrived at the fabled Lake of the Fallen Star. '
  - How did your hikes here go?
  - Dude, those trees and bushes totally destroyed me out there.
  - But that's what makes it a challenge!
  - Same. I'm not unfit but those trails really tuckered me out.
  - How about you?
  - ...
  - ' ...Oh, were you talking to me?'
  - Yeah
  - ' Just wondering if you had any struggles on your travels here?'
  - Oh... well I've done a lot of hiking growing up with my grandparents,
  - 'so the routes weren''t that troubling for me... '
  - 'but I was having some... '
  - ' hassle to make a mushroom soup yesterday...'
